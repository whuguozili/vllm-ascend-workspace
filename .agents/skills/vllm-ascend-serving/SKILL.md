# vLLM Ascend Serving

Manage the lifecycle of a **single-node colocated** `vllm-ascend` online service on a workspace-managed ready remote container or an isolated VAWS session container.

Remote substrate rule: use `.remote-dev` remote tools for ad hoc remote
read/edit/bash/search/patch work around a service. Use this skill for the
domain service lifecycle contract and keep its scripts as the compatibility
backend for managed VAWS sessions.

This skill takes structured parameters, handles all SSH escaping and remote execution internally, and returns machine-readable JSON. The agent never needs to construct raw shell commands for service management.

## Use this skill when

- the user asks to start / launch / pull up a vllm-ascend service on a managed machine
- the user asks to restart or relaunch a service (possibly with changed flags or env)
- the user asks to check if a running service is alive / ready
- the user asks to stop a running service
- another skill needs to start a service (e.g. `ascend-memory-profiling`)

## Do not use this skill when

- the task is adding, verifying, repairing, or removing a machine (use `machine-management`)
- the task is syncing code to the remote container (use `remote-code-parity`)
- the task is running benchmarks (a separate skill's responsibility)
- the task is offline inference
- the machine is not yet ready in inventory

## Critical rules

- `start` automatically runs `remote-code-parity` before launching. If parity fails, start is blocked.
- `status` and `stop` do not require parity.
- For parallel agent work, use `session-management` first and pass `--session-id <id>`. Session mode reads and writes `.vaws-local/sessions/<id>/serving.json` and never stops another session's service.
- Session mode serializes `start` / `stop` operations for the same session with a serving lock; different sessions remain independent.
- Once a remote PID is launched, `serve_start.py` writes `serving.json` with `status=starting` before health probing so `serve_stop.py` can clean up even if readiness later fails.
- Legacy `--machine` mode remains supported and keeps the previous machine-level singleton behavior.
- All remote execution goes through the scripts — never construct raw SSH commands for serving.
- Keep local runtime state under `.vaws-local/serving/` for legacy mode and `.vaws-local/sessions/<id>/` for session mode.
- Progress on `stderr` as `__VAWS_SERVING_PROGRESS__=<json>`, final result on `stdout` as JSON.

## Cross-platform launcher rule

## Public entry points

### Start a service

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  (--machine <alias-or-ip> | --session-id <id>) \
  --model <remote-weight-path> \
  [--served-model-name <name>] \
  [--tp <N>] [--dp <N>] \
  [--devices <0,1,2,3>] \
  [--extra-env KEY=VALUE ...] \
  [--port <N>] \
  [--health-timeout <seconds>] \
  [--wrap-script <remote-path>] \
  [--skip-parity] \
  [-- <extra vllm serve args>]
```

#### Launch wrapping (`--wrap-script`)

The serving skill supports a generic `--wrap-script` mechanism. When provided, the vLLM launch command is written as `_serve.sh` in the runtime directory, and the wrapper script is called with two arguments: `$1` = serve script path, `$2` = runtime directory.

This is used by other skills (e.g. `ascend-memory-profiling`) to wrap the service launch process without the serving skill needing to know the wrapping details. The serving skill is agnostic to what the wrapper does.

The `wrap_script` path is recorded in the serving state so downstream skills can detect it.

### Relaunch with previous config

```bash
# Exact same config
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  --machine <alias> --relaunch

# Add a debug env
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  --machine <alias> --relaunch --extra-env VLLM_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Remove an env from previous config
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  --machine <alias> --relaunch --unset-env MY_DEBUG_FLAG

# Remove a vllm arg from previous config (use = to avoid argparse ambiguity)
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  --machine <alias> --relaunch --unset-args=--enforce-eager

# Relaunch with a different model
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  --machine <alias> --relaunch --model /data/models/OtherModel
```

### Probe NPU device availability

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_probe_npus.py \
  --machine <alias-or-ip>
```

Returns which NPU devices are free, which are busy (with PID and HBM details), probed on the bare-metal host for cross-container visibility.

### Check status

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_status.py \
  (--machine <alias-or-ip> | --session-id <id>)
```

### Stop

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_stop.py \
  (--machine <alias-or-ip> | --session-id <id>) [--force]
```

## Local state

Per-machine launch state is stored under `.vaws-local/serving/<alias>.json`.
Session launch state is stored under `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/serving.json`.

This file records the last successful launch parameters (model, tp, devices, env, extra args, port, pid, log paths, runtime_dir, wrap_script). It is the basis for `--relaunch` and is read by other skills (e.g. `ascend-memory-profiling`) in attach mode.

During launch the same file may temporarily contain `status=starting`; this is still a valid cleanup target for `serve_stop.py`.

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve the target machine

The `--machine` argument is looked up in the local machine inventory. The machine must already be managed and ready.

### 2. Stop any existing service

If a previous service is recorded for this target, it is stopped before launching a new one. In session mode this target is the session, not the base machine, so other sessions on the same host are not touched.

### 3. Run remote-code-parity (start only)

Unless `--skip-parity` is passed, `parity_sync.py` is called to ensure the container has the current local code. If parity fails, start is blocked.

### 4. Probe NPUs

NPU availability is checked via `npu-smi info` on the **bare-metal host** (not the container). Host-level probing sees processes from all containers, bypassing PID namespace isolation. Devices with HBM usage above 4 GB are also marked busy to catch cross-container occupancy:

- If `--devices` is specified, those devices are verified to be free. If any are busy, start is blocked with the conflict details.
- If `--devices` is not specified but `--tp` is given, the first N free devices are automatically selected, where N = TP × DP (defaults to TP when DP is not set).
- If NPU probe fails (e.g. driver issue), it is treated as a non-fatal warning and launch continues with user-specified devices.

### 5. Validate and launch

- Model path is checked for existence on the remote container.
- A free port is auto-detected (or the explicit `--port` is used).
- A bash launch script is built internally with proper escaping — the agent never sees or edits this script.
- The process is started via `nohup` + `disown` and detached from the SSH session.

### 6. Wait for readiness

The script polls `/health` and `/v1/models` until both return success or the timeout expires.

### 6a. Diagnose launch failure before any code change

If the service fails during engine initialization or health check timeout:

- Read **both** `stdout.log` and `stderr.log` from the remote runtime directory — vllm often logs the actual Python exception to stdout, not stderr.
- Identify the actual exception type and message before hypothesizing a cause.
- Do not modify source code to work around a launch failure until the root cause is confirmed from logs.
- If the root cause is unclear, try the simplest launch configuration first (e.g. tp-only, no speculative decoding, no graph mode) and incrementally add features to isolate the failing component.

### 7. Return structured JSON

On success:

```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "machine": "blue-a",
  "base_url": "http://10.0.0.8:38721",
  "port": 38721,
  "pid": 12345,
  "served_model_name": "Qwen3-32B",
  "model": "/data/models/Qwen3-32B",
  "log_stdout": "/vllm-workspace/.vaws-runtime/serving/.../stdout.log",
  "log_stderr": "/vllm-workspace/.vaws-runtime/serving/.../stderr.log"
}
```

On failure, includes `stderr_tail` for diagnosis.
