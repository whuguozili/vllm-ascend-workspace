# Ascend Memory Profiling

Collect and analyze HBM memory usage on Ascend NPU devices running vLLM serving workloads. Produces a structured breakdown of memory by component, with every value traceable to its data source.

Remote substrate rule: use `.remote-dev` remote tools for ad hoc remote
read/edit/bash/search/patch work around memory profiling setup and output
inspection. Use this skill for the domain HBM workflow and keep its scripts as
the compatibility backend for managed VAWS sessions.

## Use this skill when

- the user asks to profile or analyze GPU/NPU memory (显存) usage
- the user wants to understand what consumes HBM in a vLLM serving scenario
- the user asks "权重/KV cache/HCCL/激活各占多少显存"
- the user wants to verify memory allocation against theoretical expectations
- the user asks to compare memory usage across different configurations

## Do not use this skill when

- the task is performance profiling (kernel timing, bubble analysis, step/layer/operator breakdown, cross-rank diagnosis) → use `ascend-profiling-analysis` (consumes an `ascend-profiling-collection` manifest or a remote profile root)
- the task is starting/stopping a service without memory analysis → use `vllm-ascend-serving`
- the task involves non-Ascend hardware
- the task is offline (non-serving) inference only

## Data source priority

| Priority | Source | Role | Trustworthiness |
|----------|--------|------|-----------------|
| P0 | `msprof --application` wrapping | Full component breakdown (APP, HCCL, RUNTIME, SLOG) | Highest -- sees memory torch cannot manage |
| P1 | `npu-smi info` | Static baseline + phased delta | High -- hardware-level |
| P2 | vLLM startup logs | Weights, KV cache, num_gpu_blocks | Medium-high -- application-reported |
| P3 | `safetensors` file headers | Tensor shapes, dtypes, byte sizes (byte-accurate); component classification and shard strategy are rule-based inference | High for byte sizes; medium for per-device attribution |
| P4 | Model `config.json` | Theoretical weight calculation (fallback) | Reference only |

## Memory components

| Component | Source | How derived |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Fixed overhead (driver) | npu-smi Phase 0 | HBM_Used with no user process |
| Model weights | safetensors + vLLM logs | `weight_inspector.py` 解析文件头 → 按 TP/EP/DP 分片 → 与 vLLM `DeviceMemoryProfiler` 交叉验证 |
| KV cache | vLLM logs | "Available KV cache memory: X GiB" |
| ACL Graph 编译缓冲 | vLLM logs | "Graph capturing finished in X secs, took Y GiB" |
| HCCL buffers | msprof | npu_module_mem.csv Component=HCCL (per-device when PROF→device mapping available, otherwise process-level) |
| CANN Runtime | msprof | npu_module_mem.csv Component=RUNTIME (same scoping as HCCL) |
| Activations | npu-smi delta | HBM during inference minus HBM at idle |
| 未归因残差 | Residual | 所有已知组件加总后的余量 (有 msprof 时通常 < 200 MB) |

### Residual handling

All memory attribution is based on measured data — **no estimation or guessing** is performed.

- **With msprof**: HCCL, RUNTIME, SLOG are precise msprof measurements. Any remaining residual after all components is small (typically < 200 MB) and reported as "未归因残差".
- **Without msprof**: The residual is reported as "未归因 (缺少 msprof 数据)" with an explicit note that msprof collection is needed for a complete breakdown. No attempt is made to split the residual into sub-components.

## Workflow

**Always use the `vllm-ascend-serving` skill for service lifecycle management.** This profiling skill only collects and analyzes data — it attaches to a running service. **msprof wrapping is mandatory** for a complete, traceable memory breakdown.

For parallel agent work, create or reuse a `session-management` session first, then use `--session-id <id>` or `--session-file <session.json>` everywhere below. In session mode, this skill reads serving state from `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/serving.json` and talks only to that session's dedicated container.

Session-scoped memory profiling must use `--attach`. Standalone mode starts its own service and is kept only for legacy single-tenant machine flows; it is blocked when `--session-id` or `--session-file` is used so it cannot bypass session service-port leases or shared state isolation.

### Step 0: Check msprof availability

Before starting the service, verify that msprof is available on the remote machine:

```bash
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts')
from _common import check_msprof_available, resolve_execution_target
target = resolve_execution_target('<alias-or-none>', session_id='<session-id-or-none>')
ep = target['endpoint']
print(check_msprof_available(ep))
"
```

If this fails, stop and fix the remote environment before proceeding.

### Step 1: Prepare the service with msprof (via `vllm-ascend-serving`)

Upload the msprof wrapper, then start the service with `--wrap-script`:

```bash
# Upload msprof wrapper to remote
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts')
from _common import resolve_execution_target, upload_msprof_wrapper
target = resolve_execution_target('<alias-or-none>', session_id='<session-id-or-none>')
ep = target['endpoint']
print(upload_msprof_wrapper(ep, mem_freq=50))
"
# Start service with msprof wrapping
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_start.py \
  (--machine <alias> | --session-id <id>) --model <path> --tp <N> \
  --wrap-script /tmp/_vaws_msprof_wrap.sh \
  [-- --speculative-config '...' --compilation-config '...' ...]
```

Note: `upload_msprof_wrapper` internally calls `check_msprof_available` as a safety net and writes a unique wrapper path under `/tmp` for each call.

For baseline npu-smi data, collect `npu-smi info` **before** starting the service.

### Step 2: Collect memory data (attach mode)

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts/mem_collect.py \
  --session-id <id> \
  --attach \
  [--baseline-from <previous-run-dir>] \
  [--tag <experiment-name>]
```

Use `--machine <alias-or-ip>` for legacy single-tenant workflows, or `--session-file <session.json>` when the session file path is the stable handle.

What happens:
- Reads `.vaws-local/serving/<alias>.json` or `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/serving.json` to discover port, PID, model path, tp/dp, extra args
- Auto-extracts `--speculative-config`, `--compilation-config`, etc. from the serving state
- Collects npu-smi snapshot, vLLM logs (from serving's runtime dir), weight manifest
- Sends inference request to collect activation delta
- **Does NOT** start or stop the service

### Step 3: Stop service (via `vllm-ascend-serving`)

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serve_stop.py \
  --session-id <id>
```

Use the same target form that was used for `serve_start.py`.

### Step 4: Collect msprof data

After stop, run `mem_collect --attach` again **with `--resume-run`** pointing to the run directory from Step 2. This merges the msprof CSV data into the same run, producing a single manifest with both live npu-smi data and post-stop msprof CSVs:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts/mem_collect.py \
  --session-id <id> --attach \
  --resume-run .vaws-local/memory-profiling/<run-dir-from-step-2>/
```

This works because attach mode accepts stopped services — it skips health check and inference, and focuses on collecting msprof CSVs that are now available. The `--resume-run` flag ensures all data lands in one directory.

### Step 5: Analyze and generate report

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts/mem_analyze.py \
  .vaws-local/memory-profiling/<run-dir>/ \
  [--format json|text]
```

Default `--format json` outputs machine-readable JSON to stdout (matching the repo-wide wrapper contract). Use `--format text` for a human-readable report on stdout. Both modes write `report.json` and `report.txt` files to the run directory.

### Baseline strategy

| Situation | How to get baseline |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Fresh profiling | Collect `npu-smi info` before `serve_start`, save to file, use `--baseline-from <file>` |
| Repeat profiling on same machine | Reuse baseline from a previous run via `--baseline-from <old-run-dir>` |
| Quick analysis (no baseline needed) | Omit `--baseline-from` — report shows "固定开销" as 0 with note |

`--baseline-from` accepts either a previous run directory (containing `baseline_npu_smi.txt` or `manifest.json`) or a raw `npu-smi info` output text file.

### Fallback: Standalone mode

When the serving skill is unavailable (e.g. bootstrap scenario), `mem_collect.py` can manage the service internally. This is a **fallback** — prefer the serving skill workflow above.

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts/mem_collect.py \
  --session-id <id> \
  --model <remote-weight-path> \
  --tp <N> [--dp <N>] [--tag <name>] \
  [--speculative-config '...'] [--compilation-config '...'] ...
```

This runs all phases internally: baseline → start (with msprof) → health check → snapshot → inference → stop → msprof export. msprof is always enabled in standalone mode; a pre-flight check verifies msprof availability before starting.

### Standalone: Analyze and generate report

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-memory-profiling/scripts/mem_analyze.py \
  .vaws-local/memory-profiling/<run-dir>/
```

Outputs:
- `report.txt` -- human-readable report with evidence chains
- `report.json` -- machine-readable structured report

## Interaction with other skills

| Skill | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| `vllm-ascend-serving` | **Service lifecycle**: Use `serve_start.py` to start (with `--wrap-script` for msprof), `serve_stop.py` to stop. This skill reads serving state from `.vaws-local/serving/<alias>.json` or `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/serving.json` in session mode. The serving skill is agnostic to msprof — it only knows about the wrapper script. |
| `session-management` | **Parallel isolation**: Use `session_create.py` before parallel remote work and pass `--session-id` to serving and memory collection. Session mode stores serving state under `.vaws-local/sessions/<session-id>/serving.json`. |
| `machine-management` | **SSH endpoint resolution**: Both skills share the machine inventory via `inventory` from `.agents/lib/`. |
| `remote-code-parity` | **Automatic via serving**: The serving skill calls parity sync before service start. |

## Critical rules

- **Service lifecycle belongs to `vllm-ascend-serving`** — this skill only collects and analyzes data.
- In attach mode, `mem_collect` will **never** start or stop the service itself. Service stop is done by the agent calling `serve_stop.py` directly. After stop, `mem_collect --attach` can be run again to export and collect msprof data.
- In standalone mode (fallback), the service is started and stopped within the profiling run.
- `msprof` export (8 卡) 可能需要几分钟。
- Keep collected data under `.vaws-local/memory-profiling/` only (untracked).

## Weight analysis methodology

The skill uses `weight_inspector.py` to parse safetensors file headers on the remote machine, extracting tensor names, shapes, dtypes, and byte sizes. Individual tensor byte sizes are **byte-accurate** from the file headers. Component classification (e.g. "Attention Q", "MoE Expert") and shard strategy assignment (col/row/expert parallel) are **rule-based inferences** from tensor name patterns, not direct measurements.

### How it works

1. **Parse safetensors headers**: Each `.safetensors` file starts with a JSON header containing tensor metadata (name, shape, dtype, offsets). No weight data is read — only the header (typically a few KB per file).

2. **Classify tensors**: Each tensor is categorized by name pattern:
   - `embed_tokens` → Embedding
   - `self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj` → Full Attention
   - `linear_attn.{in_proj_qkv,in_proj_z,out_proj,conv1d,...}` → Linear/Mamba Attention
   - `mlp.experts.*` → MoE Experts
   - `mlp.shared_expert.*` → MoE Shared Expert
   - `visual.*` → Vision Encoder
   - `mtp.*` → MTP (Multi-Token Prediction)
   - `norm`, `layernorm` → Layer Norms

3. **Determine shard strategy**: Each tensor is assigned a parallelism strategy:
   - `col_parallel` / `row_parallel` → divided by TP
   - `expert_parallel` → divided by EP (= TP × DP when EP enabled)
   - `replicated` → full copy on each device (norms, gates, small params)

4. **Calculate per-device weight**: Sum up per-device bytes across all tensors.

5. **Cross-validate with vLLM**: Compare safetensors-derived per-device value with vLLM's `DeviceMemoryProfiler` measurement. Expected differences:
   - **MTP embedding/lm_head sharing**: MTP reuses base model's embeddings (reduces actual memory)
   - **F32 → BF16 conversion**: Some small parameters (A_log, dt_bias) stored as F32 but may load as BF16
   - **Vision encoder in text-only mode**: Still loaded for multimodal architectures

### When the script isn't sufficient

If the safetensors-based analysis shows unexpected results, the agent should:
1. Check `weight_manifest.json` for unclassified ("other") tensors
2. Inspect vLLM's model implementation (`load_weights`) for weight sharing or skipping logic
3. Compare `model.named_parameters()` output on the remote machine with the safetensors manifest
4. Check if `enable_ep_weight_filter` affects loading behavior

## Limitations

- Activation measurement relies on npu-smi delta between idle and inference states. This captures peak but not fine-grained activation lifetime.
- `torch_npu.profiler` via vLLM's `/start_profile`/`/stop_profile` endpoints currently does not produce device-side data (device_0/data is empty). Use msprof wrapping instead.
- msprof wrapping profiles the main process only. TP worker processes are separate -- each gets its own PROF directory with per-device data.
- msprof export for 8-card runs may take several minutes. The timeout is set to 1800s.
