description: Collect one Ascend torch-profiler case end-to-end on a workspace-managed remote NPU container. Starts a profiled vLLM service, brackets a workload with /start_profile and /stop_profile, runs analyse(), verifies kernel_details.csv landed, and writes a manifest the analysis skill can consume. Use for requests like "采集 profiling", "torch profiler 跑一个 case", "采一份 profile 出来", "采 profiling 给我分析". Do not use for pure performance benchmarking, HBM/memory profiling, or for analysing already-collected profiling data (that is the analysis skill's job).

# Ascend Profiling Collection

Collect one torch-profiler case on a workspace-managed remote Ascend NPU container.

Remote substrate rule: use `.remote-dev` remote tools for ad hoc remote
read/edit/bash/search/patch work around profile setup and output inspection.
Use this skill for the domain collection workflow and keep its scripts as the
compatibility backend for managed VAWS sessions.

This skill is **only** about collection: start a profiled service, bracket a workload with `/start_profile` and `/stop_profile`, run `torch_npu.profiler.profiler.analyse(...)`, verify the device-side data actually landed, and write a manifest. Interpreting the resulting `kernel_details.csv` is a separate concern owned by the analysis skill.

## Use this skill when

- the user asks to collect / capture an Ascend torch-profiler trace for a specific config
- another skill (the analysis skill) needs a fresh profiling root with verified outputs
- the user wants to reproduce an existing root with a new model / mode / TP / DP

## Do not use this skill when

- the task is performance benchmarking only — use `vllm-ascend-benchmark`
- the task is HBM / memory analysis — use `ascend-memory-profiling`
- the task is analysing an already-collected profiling root (no need to re-collect)
- the machine is not yet ready in inventory — use `machine-management`

## Boundary with other skills

| Skill | Owns | This skill uses it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vllm-ascend-serving` | Service lifecycle, `--profiler-config` passthrough | `serve_start.py` / `serve_stop.py` only; serving is **agnostic** to the profiler window |
| `remote-code-parity` | Local-to-container code sync | Implicit — invoked by `serve_start.py` |
| `vllm-ascend-benchmark` | `vllm bench serve` performance numbers | Not used; benchmark skill must not learn the profiler control plane |
| `ascend-memory-profiling` | HBM attribution via msprof | Independent; not invoked |

`/start_profile` and `/stop_profile` exist *because of* profiling, so the control-plane client lives here, not in `vllm-ascend-serving`.

## Critical rules

- The serving skill must remain profiling-agnostic. Never push profiler-window control or `analyse()` invocation into it.
- `--profiler-config` is the only profiling-related thing the serving skill knows about, and only because vLLM accepts it as an opaque blob.
- Run profiling **inside the remote container**. Never copy raw `*_ascend_pt` directories back to the local Mac.
- Hard-fail in three cases (all detailed in "Failure policy"):
  1. any rank's `kernel_details.csv` is missing after `analyse()`
  2. number of `*_ascend_pt` directories does not match `tp * (dp or 1)`
  3. workload was not real — follow-up request failed or benchmark wave fell below `--benchmark-success-threshold`
- Progress on `stderr` as `__VAWS_PROFILING_COLLECTION_PROGRESS__=<json>`. Final manifest on `stdout` as one JSON object.
- For parallel agent work, create a session first and pass `--session-id <id>`. Service start/stop and parity then stay scoped to that session.
- Local state lives under `.vaws-local/ascend-profiling-collection/runs/` for collection manifests; serving/parity state follows the target mode.

### Required parameters and why

The script intentionally has no Qwen-specific defaults. The agent must always pass:

| Required arg | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `--machine` or `--session-id` | Target container; sessions are preferred for parallel work |
| `--model` / `--served-model-name` | Different cases need different models, no safe default |
| `--tp` | Hardware shape; never assume it |
| `--mode` | The profile is meaningless without recording which graph mode produced it |
| `--request-kind` | Determines payload assembly (text vs VL) |
| `--benchmark-output-tokens` | Decode length is the dominant knob for what the trace looks like |
| `--tag` | Stable identifier folded into the run-dir name and manifest |

`--speculative-tokens 0` (the default) means "do not pass `--speculative-config` at all". Set to a positive integer to enable MTP/Eagle.

## Auxiliary entry points

The agent can call these directly if it already has a service running and only wants to flip the profiler window or re-run `analyse()` on an existing root.

### Flip the profiler window

```bash
# Start a profile window on a service that the serving skill already launched
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-profiling-collection/scripts/profile_control.py \
  (--machine <alias> | --session-id <id>) --action start_profile [--timeout 900]

# Close it
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-profiling-collection/scripts/profile_control.py \
  (--machine <alias> | --session-id <id>) --action stop_profile [--timeout 900]
```

The script reads the service port from `.vaws-local/serving/<alias>.json` in legacy mode or `.vaws-local/sessions/<id>/serving.json` in session mode. A service must be running.

### Re-run `analyse()` on an existing root

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ascend-profiling-collection/scripts/run_remote_analyse.py \
  --machine <alias> --profile-root <remote-path> \
  [--expected-ranks <N>]
```

Discovers every `*_ascend_pt` under `--profile-root`, runs `torch_npu.profiler.profiler.analyse()` on each, and verifies that `ASCEND_PROFILER_OUTPUT/kernel_details.csv` and `trace_view.json` landed. Exits non-zero if any rank is incomplete.

Always pass `--expected-ranks` (typically `tp * (dp or 1)`) when running this against a fresh capture: without it a partial collection where some ranks never produced a directory looks "clean" because every directory that *did* land was complete. The orchestrator passes this automatically.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve machine** via inventory; container endpoint comes from `machine-management`.
2. **Build serving args** — encode `--profiler-config` (always written) and the chosen graph mode.
3. **Start service** by shelling out to `serve_start.py`. Parity sync is automatic via the serving skill.
4. **Open SSH tunnel** to the service port so workload requests can be assembled locally (multimodal payloads need local image encoding).
5. **POST `/start_profile`** with the long control-plane timeout.
6. **Send benchmark wave** (concurrent chat-completions) followed by **one follow-up tail request**. The follow-up is intentionally short to capture a clean steady-state step.
7. **POST `/stop_profile`**.
8. **Stop service** by shelling out to `serve_stop.py`.
9. **Discover and analyse** every `*_ascend_pt` under `<runtime_dir>/<torch_profiler_dir>` via `run_remote_analyse.py`.
10. **Verify outputs** per rank; classify each as `ok | partial | missing_kernel_details`.
11. **Write manifest** to `.vaws-local/ascend-profiling-collection/runs/<timestamp>_<tag>/manifest.json`.

## Failure policy

Accuracy beats coverage. The script exits non-zero (status `failed`) when **any** of:

- the service did not become `ready`
- `/start_profile` or `/stop_profile` returned non-2xx
- **workload was not real**: `workload_status.status != "ok"`, i.e. the
  follow-up request failed or the benchmark wave's success rate was below
  `--benchmark-success-threshold` (default 0.8). Without real traffic during
  the profile window the trace records nothing useful.
- **rank count mismatch**: number of `*_ascend_pt` directories `!= tp * (dp or 1)`
  → `analysis_status == "rank_count_mismatch"`. Some rank never dumped its
  profiler data; even if every directory that *did* land is complete, the
  topology is broken and downstream cross-rank analysis would be wrong.
- any rank's `kernel_details.csv` is missing after `analyse()` →
  `analysis_status == "missing_kernel_details"`

The last condition is the canonical "device-side data did not land" failure
documented in `doc/profiling-inventory.md`. Treat all of the above as
**re-collect required**, not as something the analysis skill can recover from.

If the orchestrator fails after `serve_start`, it always tries to stop the service (graceful, then `--force`) so no orphan vLLM process is left behind.

## Manifest schema

The manifest is the input contract for the analysis skill. Important fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Bumped when fields are renamed or removed |
| `tag`, `started_at`, `completed_at` / `failed_at` | Run identity |
| `machine`, `model`, `served_model_name`, `tp`, `dp` | Hardware / model identity |
| `mode`, `speculative_tokens`, `speculative_method`, `enable_expert_parallel`, `api_server_count` | What was profiled |
| `request_kind`, `prompt_tokens`, `benchmark_output_tokens`, `followup_output_tokens`, `benchmark_total_requests`, `benchmark_concurrency`, `benchmark_success_threshold` | What workload produced the trace and what success bar it had to clear |
| `expected_ranks` | `tp * (dp or 1)` — what `analyse()` was told to enforce |
| `torch_profiler_with_stack`, `torch_profiler_dir` | Profiler depth and on-disk location |
| `serve_args` | Exact `serve_start.py` argv (audit trail) |
| `service_result`, `start_profile`, `stop_profile`, `stop_result` | Sub-call outputs |
| `benchmark_results`, `followup_result` | Per-request status / latency / response body |
| `workload_status` | `{status, bench_total, bench_ok, bench_success_rate, bench_threshold, followup_ok}` — workload hard gate |
| `remote_profile_root` | Path the analysis skill passes to its `analyze.py` |
| `remote_profile_dirs` | Per-rank `{path, outputs, analysis_status}` |
| `rank_count` | Number of `*_ascend_pt` directories actually found |
| `analysis_status` | `ok` / `partial` / `rank_count_mismatch` / `missing_kernel_details` — analysis hard gate |
| `status` | `ok` / `failed`. `ok` requires both `analysis_status == "ok"` and `workload_status.status == "ok"` |
| `error` | Set when `status == failed`; lists which gate(s) tripped |
